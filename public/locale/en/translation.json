The interior design turns into an aesthetic site that highlights all its angles. By mixing different types of lighting, and taking into account light directions to create distinctive effects that suit every room of the house, we have different types of lighting, each of which has a specific use, which can be divided into 5 main types. Natural lighting based on wall openings such as windows facing a natural lighting source such as the sun. Artificial lighting. Resulting from artificial light sources such as electric lamps, it is divided into three main types for lighting the interior space. General lighting for the interior space. Lighting that includes all directions of the room in a dispersed manner, covering the place in general. Functional lighting provides concentrated lighting to perform a specific task, such as concentrated lighting on both sides of the bed. Concentrated lighting is a type of lighting. Topical, focusing on a specific thing in the room or artistic needs in the design that are displayed in it and highlighted on an artistic painting. When choosing the appropriate lighting distribution method, we take into account several factors, including the size of the space. The amount of lighting required varies according to the size of the space and the type of room. Lighting needs vary according to the purpose of the space. Like the living room, it needs a larger amount of general lighting than the bedrooms, and it can depend on mixing different types of lighting. Type of decoration. Lighting can affect the general decoration style of the house. We avoid several other factors, such as distributing spotlight bulbs on the ceiling randomly and in a large number in order to provide light spread throughout. The room, because it is incorrect information, is the plaque placed directly on the sink so that there is no shadow on the mirror. Strong lighting that is annoying to the eye, and comfortable and dim lighting, as well as relying on the decorative appearance of the lighting unit instead of thinking about its functional value.
